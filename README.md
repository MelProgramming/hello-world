# hello-world
This repository is used for practicing the GitHub flow.

Hello, I am Mel. I am hoping to learn more about computer programming and all sorts of things.
This is my journey towards learning GitHub commands in order to submit my projects with several versions and
updates and such. GitHub is going to be useful for my journey and I hope to make really cool things. Some things
that I thought were cool were that a lot of code is free for the public for GitHub, namely the video game osu! has all of its active files on GitHub in which the creator Dean Herbert publishes for the public.
